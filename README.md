---

## Overview

RouteSense helps websites recover from broken, mistyped, or shuffled URLs by intelligently routing users to the correct page. Instead of serving a 404, RouteSense analyzes incoming requests and finds the best match from your existing routes no custom fuzzy logic required.

## What's Done So Far

- **Route normalization** – Clean and standardize URL patterns
- **Route validation** – Verify route integrity and structure
- **Route classification** – Categorize routes as semantic, template-based, or ignore
- **Initial ingestion pipeline** – Store and index routes for matching

## Why RouteSense?

- Eliminates unnecessary 404 errors and improves user experience
- Saves developers from reinventing URL matching logic for every project

## Current Status

Early work-in-progress. Building in public.
